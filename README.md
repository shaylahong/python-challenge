# Module 3: Python Challenge

This challenge encourages the development of familiarity with the Python language in order to analyse data, particularly from CSV files, effectively. 

There are two sections to this challenge: PyBank and PyPoll. Both of these have their respective folders that comprise an 'Analysis' folder that contains a text file with the results from the analysis, a 'Resources' folder that contains the CSV file used, and a python script file named 'main.py'. 

In the first section of the challenge, PyBank, we are required to develop a Python script to analyse the profit and losses of a company using 'budget_data.csv' to produce a coherent and simple financial analysis. This covers areas such as: the total number of months included in the dataset; the net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period; the changes in profit and losses over the entire period, and the average of these changes; and, the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period. This takes an extensive dataset and simplifies it to the critical information that is needed. 

The second component of this challenge is PyPoll; the requirement here is to develop a Python script that seeks to modernises a small U.S town's vote-counting process. Similar to PyBank, the data is retrieved from a CSV file titled 'election_data.csv' to provide the information necessary. To do that, we are required to find: the total number of votes cast; a complete list of candidates who received votes; the percentage of votes each candidate won; and, the winner of the election based on popular vote.
